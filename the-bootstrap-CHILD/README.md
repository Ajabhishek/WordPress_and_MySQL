THE BOOTSTRAP CHILD THEME
=========================

## A child theme sample 
In order to run it you must install "The-bootstrap" theme by Konstantin Obenland from the repositories.
URL: https://wordpress.org/themes/the-bootstrap

The purpose of the pages is to demonstrate:

* How to use the $wpdp object on a custom page.
* How to run MySQL queries on a custom page via PHP.

## Instagram Images
And as a little extra something, I've added instagram.js and instagram.php.
That's costum pages that'll get images via Ajax and the Instagram API.
If you've followed these pages the code to this is known chess theory.
Now you can use the Instagram API on a costum WordPress page.
